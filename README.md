# Tragic Trojan

In computing, a Trojan horse is any malware which misleads users of its true intent.

That presents the question, what is the true intent?

### The true intent

Pwnage. Total domination of a system.
But realistically the goal of this project is learning the basics of malware development.

### The components

   * A useful application? Or maybe not so useful...A game?
      * Pygame will help to achieve this.
   * The backdoor.
      * Python sockets.
      * Going to need some form of AV evasion.
