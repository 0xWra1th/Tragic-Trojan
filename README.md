  <h3 align="center">Tragic Trojan</h3>
</p>
<br/>
In computing, a Trojan horse is any malware which misleads users of its true intent.

That presents the question, what is the true intent?

### The true intent

Pwnage. Total domination of a system.
But realistically the goal of this project is learning the basics of malware development.

### The components

   * A useful application? Or maybe not so useful...A game?
      * Originally chose to use Pygame but it's pretty trash.
      * Decided to move everything to C++ so I'll use another library to help with the development. 
   * The backdoor.
      * ~~Python~~ C++ sockets.
      * Going to need some form of AV evasion.
